# US-AIRLINE-ANALYSIS-
Project Overview

The U.S. Airline Performance Analysis project evaluates the operational efficiency and punctuality of major U.S. airlines using a comprehensive dataset of one million flights. The primary objectives are to:

Identify patterns in flight delays, cancellations, and route distribution.

Provide actionable insights for improving airline performance and passenger satisfaction.

The project leverages Power BI to visualize key metrics such as total flights, average delays, airline-wise performance, seasonal trends, and geographical coverage. Through a combination of line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and maps, the analysis highlights high-delay periods, major contributing airlines, and key flight routes.

By integrating quantitative metrics with intuitive visualizations, this project enables stakeholders to monitor performance, pinpoint operational bottlenecks, and implement strategies to enhance on-time arrivals and overall efficiency in the U.S. airline industry
